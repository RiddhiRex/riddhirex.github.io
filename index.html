	<p>I am an enthusiastic Software Developer having <b>5+ years of Software Development experience</b> currently working in <b>Cisco Systems, San Jose, CA.</b></p><br>
<p>I was born and brought up in Southern part of India. I did my undergraduate in Computer Science after which I joined a Software Company 
	specializing in Networking products. After a while, I moved to US to pursue <b>Masters in Computer Science from Stony Brook University at New York</b>. 
	My interest for Networking got me a Summer Internship and then a full time job in the same stream.
<p>I am adept in End-to-End development of software products. I have <b>worked extensively in areas of Networking</b> mainly in Datacom(Layer 2 and Layer 3).
	I am well versed in coding in C, C++ Python and Java. Focused, Hardworking and a good team player with keen interest to acquire new skills. Every new day starts with an urge to learn something new. </p><br>
	<p>Apart from coding, I enjoy traveling to new places and meeting people.

The proposed approach uses building information and estimated UE position for making
handover decision. Simulation results showed that our proposed approach achieves 31.5%
improvement in reducing handover delay compared to existing HO scheme. This work was
supported by the Deity, Govt of India. For more info: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6802870/">

A spam filter is a program which is used to identify unsolicited and unwanted emails and prevent them from going to the user's inbox. 
													  It achieves this by making decision whether a mail is spam or ham based on certain pre-learnt judgments.
													  The model is made to learn to identify a spam and ham mail by passing the features to the Naive Bayes model. 
													  Spam and Ham mails are detected with an accuracy of 72%. The Source Code can be found in https://github.com/RiddhiRex/Spam_mails_Filter ">
